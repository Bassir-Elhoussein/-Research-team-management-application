== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Molongui Authorship work with my theme? =

Yes. Molongui Authorship will work with any theme, but may require [premium styling features](https://www.molongui.com/authorship/) to make it match nicely.

= Where is the author box displayed? =

The author box is displayed there where you want it to be displayed. You can configure to show it on all posts and pages or just on those you select. Also, you can choose whether to display it above or below the content.

You can also automatically show the author box on any custom post-type or add as many author boxes as you wish anywhere with the Pro version of the plugin, which is available [here](https://www.molongui.com/authorship/ "Molongui Authorship Pro").

= Why should I give credit to authors who write in my blog? =

Whatever your reason for having a blog, whether it's for business or a personal hobby, it's important to do it right. In order to boost SEO rankings, gain traffic and leads, you need to have great content on your blog. And when it comes to creating great content, it really does matter who is writing. Authorship provides significant benefits:

* Higher click through rates
* Higher visibility
* Higher page views
* Lower plagiarism
* Build trust
* Elevate the role of the writer
* Establish authority

[Molongui Authorship plugin](https://www.molongui.com/authorship/ "Molongui Authorship plugin") allows you to give credit to any author who writes in your blog, whether it has a registered user on your WordPress installation or not (guest author). Check the plugin features above.

= What if the post is written by a guest author? =

A custom post-type is defined so guest authors can be chosen as post authors without having a registered account on your WordPress site. Use "Guest authors" from the WP admin menu and add a new guest author.

= Why would I care about guest posting? =

Whether you are a re-known author or not, guest posting is a good strategy for growing your blog readership and platform. "Guest posting" means writing and publishing an article on someone else's website or blog. If you allow people guest-posting on your site, you need a way to give them credit for their content so it can be a win-win situation for both (you and your guest authors). Authorship is important to the reputation, professional advancement and financial support of bloggers.

= Why some social media profiles are premium options? =

Only those social media networks which are intended for business and professional networking are only available in the Pro version of the plugin.

= Where are all the social networks the plugin features? I can't see them all... =

To avoid clutter the edit page, some social networks are not displayed by default. To configure which networks to display, go to the plugin settings page.

= Where can I find documentation and user guides? =

For help setting up and configuring this plugin, please refer to our [documentation](https://www.molongui.com/docs/).
